# The Open Urban Mapping project

Introduction
------------
Buildings are commonly put on a map by digitizing their shapes in satellite imagery. If done manually, this can be a time-consuming and expensive task. This project attempts to automate this process by delegating the digitizing routine to _neural networks_. It is now possible to digitize every building in the world using _computer vision_ and _satellite imagery_. Our technology is powered by _open stack_ and we strive to contribute our results back to the community by filling the data gaps in [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org).    

## The ongoing progress of Urban Mapping

In the map below, we've transformed both Geoalert and OSM polygons into points by taking their centroids and compared the results (as of Dec 2019, Russia). [Vector tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_tiles) are used to visulalize both layers.

To continue the research and implementation of Urban Mapping premium tehnology we did a few pilot projects with commercial companies. (E.g. [the description and the dataset](https://github.com/Geoalert/vidnoe_benchmark) created with Russian Post)

## Buildings Statistics - Russia

Based in Russia, we've picked its territory as our testing ground. By now, we've automaticaly extracted _54+ mln building features_ using different satellite imagery sources. We compared our statistics with OSM in terms of buildings count ratio. The statistics are displayed by [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_subjects_of_Russia).

## Open datasets - Russia

Open datasets were created based on the processing of ["Mapbox satellite"](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/satellite) global base map for futher contribution into Openstreetmap project (under "ODbL" License).
Mapbox satellite has comparatively poor quality for Russian territory, therefore the datasets have to be validated quite carefully. The data is updated by regions of higher buildings count ratio comparing to OSM.

|Country|Region|Building heights| Building types|Feature count| Count ratio, OSM, dec 2019 | Format|Size (unzipped)|
|-------------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Rus|[**Bashkortostan**](https://filebrowser.aeronetlab.space/s/CSQGJbrZFsaHJOY)| - | âœ“ | 998,215| 4 | GeoPackage | 210Mb |

## Mapping contribution
If you are OSM volunteer you can use this data to contribute to OSM. It's recommended to avoid imports before you check and validate automatically generated buildings.

The auto-mapping approach also can used to help create maps in case of emergencies as in [Irkutsk region, Russia, that was heavily flooded in the summer 2019](https://geoalert.github.io/Irkutsk-flood/) - so we appreciate any related contribution and/or data requests.

If you have time to help with documentation, integration of datasets into third-party applications like JOSM, Rapid, etc. to help promoting this project, please check for the [issues](https://github.com/Geoalert/urban-mapping/issues) or create one. Contact us directly at [hello@geoalert.io](mailto:hello@geoalert.io)

## Classification
Here is the generalized classification of buildings. We are looking to include more classes and improve the accuracy.
